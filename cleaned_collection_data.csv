Most Soviet war films from this time were designed to show how the hero's class consciousness as a proletarian was developed. The poster itself draws on elements of avant-garde art movements by fusing images of the film's characters with machines, utilizing photomontage, and how it is drawn in strong angular lines.",WCMA-PRINTS,1928.0

183,SEG.10.21,1903-01-01,Grave pot,Egyptian,terracotta,"Excavated by W.M. Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

Dionysos, holding a drinking horn and wearing an ivy wreath on his head faces Artemis. Standing at the horses' heads is a male figure, whose head is obscured by the animals. This figure is marked as the god Hermes by his winged boots. The iconography of this vase may represent a nuptial scene. A double row of ivy circles the neck.

3812,SEG.10.19,1903-01-01,Grave pot,Egyptian,terracotta,"Excavated by W.M. Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

4235,SEG.10.20,1903-01-01,Grave pot,Egyptian,terracotta,"Excavated by W.M. Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

He wears a kilt, sidelock, and the double crown of upper and lower Egypt. His right forefinger is held to his lips in a gesture meant to signify his youth. The cult of Harpokrates rapidly grew in popularity during the late first millennium BC.

7244,CG.2,1887-01-01,Apulian Red Figure Oinochoe,Greek,terracotta,"A black gloss covers the body of this trefoil oinochoe.  A band of tongues wraps around three quarters of the shoulder, spanning the width of the figural scene below.  A narrow band, marking the ground line, encircles the lower belly. On the left, a rectangular pillar marks the border of the figural scene that decorates the pot's belly.  Here, we see two male figures who turn towards the center, facing each other. Although the man on the left is draped and the man on the right is nude, they are visually aligned by their scale, pose, and position.  The two figures are the same height. Both stand in a contrapposto; the draped figure puts his weight on his left leg and the nude on his right.  The figures therefore mirror each other in pose and create a visual chiasmus.  Both men stand about stand on either side of a short reserved rectangle, which represents an altar.  The altar is aligned vertically with the central curve of the trefoil lip, marking the center of the scene.  Because the men face inwards, towards the altar, they function as bookends to the scene and create a balanced, closed composition. The symmetry is disrupted only by the tall rectangle (or altar) at the left, which is visible only when the vase is rotated.  There is no corresponding altar on the right. ",WCMA-ANCIENT,-362.5

8882,SEG.10.24,1903-01-01,Grave pot,Egyptian,terracotta,"Excavated by W.M. Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

9821,SEG.10.25,1903-01-01,Grave pot,Egyptian,terracotta,"Excavated by W.M. Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

Murray and Lanman Florida Water was introduced into the United States market on February 14, 1808. Immediately it gained popularity and approval from the consumer and became a worldwide, well-known cologne, not only because of it's delightful fragrance but also because of the more than twenty uses attributed to it.

He is nude and his head clean shaven except for the usual braided sidelock. On his head sits the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. His right forefinger is held to his lips in a gesture meant to signify his youth. The cult of Harpokrates rapidly grew in popularity during the late first millennium BC. This is likely due to close association at the time between Harpokrates and the Egyptian pharaoh, who was commonly considered to be an earthly embodiment of Horus.",WCMA-ANCIENT,50.0

12314,SEG.10.16,1903-01-01,Grave pot,Egyptian,terracotta,"Excavated by W.M. Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

12964,SEG.10.23,1903-01-01,Grave pot,Egyptian,terracotta,"Excavated by W.M. Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

Trefoil oinochoe with two disks at the junction of the handle and rim.  Three parallel lines encircle the neck.  The principle design consists of a band of lions, depicted in relief. Three lions are shown walking to the right. The lions are separated by long, vertical shapes that taper at the ends.  Two parallel incised lines mark the bottom of the decorative panel. According to Rasmussen's criteria for Etruscan pottery, this oinochoe can be designated as Type 4C.Cf. Boston Museum of Fine Art 13.89; The British Museum 1839, 1025.11; The J.

He wears a close-fitting cap with uraeus and a large, braided sidelock. The head, torso and leges of this figure were cast separately. The cult of Harpokrates rapidly grew in popularity during the late first millennium BC. This is likely due to close association at the time between Harpokrates and the Egyptian pharaoh, who was commonly considered to be an earthly emodiment of Horus.",WCMA-ANCIENT,-704.0

19940,SEG.10.26,1903-01-01,Grave pot,Egyptian,terracotta,"Excavated by W.M. Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

22373,SEG.10.18,1903-01-01,Grave pot,Egyptian,terracotta,"Excavated by W.M. Flinders Petrie in 1903-04 at Abydos and sent to Williams in 1906.The Egyptologist Flinders Petrie was the first to organize pottery, using clay, surface treatment, and shape as the basic criteria in his corpus for dating Predynastic vessels. Petrie's categories are not completely consistent.  He did not always separate clay material from technological aspects, but the categories were logical, and so scholars still use them today.  Predynastic pottery is made from either Nile clay or marl clay.  The first produces a red, brown, or black surface when fired, while the second generate a hard dense fabric of white, green, orange, or beige.  Marl clay was not used prior to Naqada II (ca. 3600 B.C.), and its introduction in the pottery repertoire marked a significant innovation in how some vessels were subsequently produced.  The consistency among form and decoration of marl clay vessels indicates that for the first time, specialist - not local potters - manufacture pottery.  The method used by a potter to prepare the vessel's surface also characterized the finished vessel.  Slipping burnishing, polishing, and applied decoration were all used to finish Predynastic pottery.  Firing temperatures and conditions also created differences in a vessel's final appearance.

The second woman holds a circular object in her hand, likely a garland.  The third figure is a man.  The motion of his gait is visible by his separated legs.  Like the women, he holds his arms akimbo, perhaps in a gesture of greeting or veneration.  The man holds another circular object (or garland).  Facing them, seated in a high-backed chair with a bird underneath, is a figure who raises on arm and holds a spear in another.  Standing with her back to this seated figure is a woman, who also raises one arm and holds a garland in the other.  She faces another seated man.  This man sits in a chair whose legs form an X underneath the seat.  He holds a garland.  Behind this seated man is another standing figure, who faces the same direction and the two seated mean and holds a spear.  ",WCMA-ANCIENT,-575.0

In the bottom left and right corners, Olitski's experimentation with spray painitng is on display. He approached printmaking much as he did painting. Like the canvases of the period, the silkscreens are more or less unbroken expanses of saturated high key color, punctuated by incidents confined to the edges. He used the orange particles to further intensify the viewer's connection with the blue by creating a vibrant yet subtle contrast of complementary colors at the print's edges.

It was executed in Poughkeepsie, New York while Healy was taking a vacation to visit friends and family in the midst of his rigorous schedule of portrait commissions. After completing some royal portraits in Romania, Healy departed for New York accompanied by Edith, Kathleen, and his wife. This is likely when the portrait of Edith was executed. Most of Healy's portraits of his family stayed in the family or were bought by private collectors. This portrait was not shown by the National Academy.",WCMA-PAINTING,1891.0

Robert Hamilton was sent to India by the East India Company to make silver for the English, who were then running the country, that was more suitable to their tastes than the locally produced silver. Mr. Hamilton initially made silver under his own name/marks until approximately 1808 when he established the company, which was known as the Garrard of India, under license from the EIC. The egg server weighs approximately 37 oz. It is 7.5 cm high, not counting the finial, 13.7 cm interior diameter and 14.3 cm exterior diameter. Wynyard R.T. Wilkinson has written two very good books on Indian Colonial Silver and examples of a few pieces made by  Hamilton are  illustrated therein. As I said  previously, the only example of his work I have been able to find on this continent is a pot of much later date made by his company and owned by the William & Francine Clark Museum.",WCMA-DEC ARTS,1820.0

The woodcut on view relates to a Rubens drawing in the Louvre (Lugt 1132); no comparable painting is known, though the perspective view of the garden is a quote from the Villa Borghese painting in Rome (1608-09) and the rectangular format with balustrade and fountain originates in the Academia de San Fernando painting in Madrid (c. 1610). The subject is from the Book of Daniel, which describes the attempted seduction, refusal, and eventual triumph of Susanna over Elders of the community.
